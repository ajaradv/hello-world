# hello-world


Hello Folks!

My name is Alex, I am a software engineer and like to play with different tools so I keep many in my toolchest. I'm familiar with perl, java, c language and just recently started to get familiar with javascript and javascript related frameworks. I'm currently learning more about Angular 2 and I figured it was about time to start keeping a personal git repo.

Alex-
